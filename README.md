## Project 4 Information
- Gained experience breaking a project into manageable components, writing JS code for Node.js server applications, writing and using code modules, using modern JS syntax, writing Node.js REST API servers using VSCode, using Fastify with the GET verb, routes, and route parameters, working with static data, testing code modules without using a web server, using Postman to test servers, and working with JSON data

- I felt good with this project as it allowed me to apply everything I learned earlier in the term and gain confidence with Node.js REST APIS
